//            **Class **is a user-defined data type which defines its properties and its methods , it is like a blueprint.
//
//            **Object **is a run-time entity. It is an instance of the class. An object can represent a person, place or any other item.


    //Class - Blueprint
    //
    //> Attributes(Properties)  ||  Behaviour(Functions,Methods)
    //For example if its a person class it will have attributes like name , age , gender etc
    // and its functionality is walk() , eat , sleep()


    //Object
    // if there is a dog class which has attributes breed , Size and color and it has functionality like Eat() , Sleep() , Sit() , Run()
    //so when we create difffrent dog brreds by objects thats were we connect with the real objecct and clas remains a blue print

    //- _static or class fields - These fields are common to any object within the same class. They can only exist once in the class irrespective of the total number of objects in the class._
    //- _static or class methods - These methods do not affect a specific object in the class._
    //- _inner classes - At times a class will be defined within a class if it is a subset of another class. The class contained within another is the inner class._
