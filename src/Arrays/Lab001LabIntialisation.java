//# Arrays
//- Array is a collection of data which is of **similar type.**
//- 10th Marks - 90,91,92,94 data -> int into arrays.
//- names of Students -> amit, lucky, pramod.
//- Array is also called as **Homogeneous data structure**.
//- Elements of an array will be stored in contiguous memory locations.
//There is no fundamental difference between arr.length and str.length in terms of what they representâ€”they both return an integer value.
// However, they apply to different data types and have slightly different behavior. arr.length is used to get the number of elements in an array,
// while str.length returns the number of characters in a string. In JavaScript, a key distinction is that arr.length can be modified to change the size of the array (e.g., truncating or extending it), whereas str.length is read-only and cannot be altered directly. Despite this difference,
// both are properties (not functions), so they are accessed without parentheses.
