//#### **Scanner class**
//        - Class, it  has a inbuilt method like nextInt, , next, nextFloat.
//-  These inbuilt methods can be used to basically get an input from a user and assign directly into their respective data types.
//        - `You can use the Scanner class; it's an inbuilt class provided by Java. You have to create the object by using the new operator. The moment you use it, you can directly use their functions to get input from a user.`
//        -

import java.util.Scanner;
// 1. Different Purposes
//nextInt() reads only an integer (it stops reading when it hits whitespace like a space or newline).
//
//nextLine() reads a full line of text â€” until the user presses Enter.
