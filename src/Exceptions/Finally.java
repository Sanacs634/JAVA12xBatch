//âœ… What is finally in Java?
//The finally block is used to execute important code such as:
//
//Closing resources
//
//Cleaning up
//
//Ensuring code runs regardless of exceptions
//
//It always runs after try and catch, even if:
//
//An exception is thrown
//
//No exception is thrown
//
//The method returns early
