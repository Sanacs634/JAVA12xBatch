package Encapsulation;
//Encapsulation is the process of wrapping data (variables) and code (methods) together into a single unit (class) and restricting access to the internal data using access modifiers.
//
//Goals of Encapsulation:
//Keep class variables private
//
//Provide public getter/setter methods to access them
//
//Control how the internal data is accessed or modified
