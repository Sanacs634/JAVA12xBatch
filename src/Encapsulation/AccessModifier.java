    //Access modifiers are **keywords** that define the visibility or accessibility of classes, methods, and variables.

    //1. This is the least restrictive access level.
    //

    //**The private modifier restricts access to the class itself.** Members declared as private are not accessible from any other class, even subclasses.
    //
    //
    //
    //The **protected** modifier allows access to members within the same package and also to subclasses in different packages.
