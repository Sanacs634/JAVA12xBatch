    //Abstraction is one of the core concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP).
    // It refers to the process of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.
    //➡️ Abstraction hides the internal complexity and exposes only what’s necessary.
//    In languages like Java, C#, and Python, abstraction is achieved using:
//
//    Abstract Classes
//
//    Interfaces
}
//Feature	        Abstraction	                                                        Encapsulation
//Definition	    Hiding implementation details and showing only essential features	Hiding data by bundling it with methods that operate on it
//Focus	            Focuses on what an object does	                                    Focuses on how to protect object’s data
//Achieved By	    Using abstract classes or interfaces	                            Using access modifiers (private, public, etc.)
//Purpose	        To simplify and model real-world behavior	                        To secure and restrict access to data
//Real-LifeAnalogy	Driving a car without knowing how the engine works	                Keeping your ATM PIN hidden and only accessible via a method
//Main Benefit	    Simplifies usage and reduces complexity	                            Increases security and data protection
